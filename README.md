# 🥔 Potato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

## 📘 Project Description
This project develops a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically classify potato leaves into three categories:
- 🌿 **Healthy**
- 🍂 **Early Blight**
- 🍁 **Late Blight**

The goal is to provide a deep learning-based tool that helps detect diseases in potato plants early, improving agricultural productivity and reducing losses.
