#  Potato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

##  Project Description
This project develops a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically classify potato leaves into three categories:
-  **Healthy**
-  **Early Blight**
-  **Late Blight**

The goal is to provide a deep learning-based tool that helps detect diseases in potato plants early, improving agricultural productivity and reducing losses.
